# PIPSQUEAK  
Mizzou Senior Capstone Project 2015  
  
Note:  	(╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻  Changed all the things back to a normal git setup.  I didn't like the PIPSQUEAK folder thing with nw.js outside.  
		New instructions! Read below  
  
Pre-Installation/Development instructions:  
1. Download and Install Node.js (Make sure "npm" and "ADD TO PATH" is selected in the installation): http://nodejs.org/download/  
2. Test Node by running "npm -v" (no quotes) from a terminal.  Should show you the latest version.  
3. Run "npm install" and all the dependencies and NW.js will install automatically (if not already installed). 
  
To run the application (after following the above 3 steps):  
On Windows: Double-click PIPSQUEAK-Install.bat wait for it to install.  
			Double-click PIPSQUEAK.bat  
On all the platforms: open a terminal and type "npm start" from the project directory.
